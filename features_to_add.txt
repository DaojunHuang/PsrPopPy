Suggested future features:
  - RRATs? 
  - Binary parameters & effect on SNR (cf. Bagchi paper)
  - Scintillation effects?
  - work out which pulsars are discovered in a given survey or merely
    detected, based on preceeding surveys
  - update viewhist to work a little more like wxview, choose parameter to plot
