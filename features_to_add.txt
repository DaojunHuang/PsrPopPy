Suggested future features:
  - Keep track of which pulsars are found in which surveys?
  - RRATs / nullers -- just have a switch for a on fraction?
  - Binary parameters & effect on SNR (cf. Bagchi paper)

  - Modify the reference frequency somehow. I think using a variable is
    counter-productive. Why should I have to pass the population in here?
    Maybe keep the same but store it in the pulsar???? Or make it a constant
        def _SNfac(... , ref_freq = 1400.)
